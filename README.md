# MarketMonarch

**MarketMonarch** is a Maven-based Java prototype trading bot designed for use with [Interactive Brokers](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/).  
It executes trades, performs technical analysis, logs activity, generates session reports, and emails them to you.  
Think of it as a *robotic trader* who is very eager to trade‚Ä¶ but not particularly good at making you rich (more on that below).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

1. **I take zero responsibility for any financial losses** this software may cause.  
   If it *did* make money consistently, I probably wouldn't be sharing it for free ‚Äî I‚Äôd be sipping cocktails on a beach somewhere.  
2. **It is a prototype** ‚Äî lots of features can (and should) be improved.  
   For example:
   - Move trading constants into a config file instead of hard-coding them
   - Implement smarter entry/exit logic
   - Actually use the calculated performance metrics for decision-making  
3. **You must create a configuration file** that contains your database connection details before running.

## üìä Performance Metrics

> **Important:** Formulas exist in the code, but their results are **not yet integrated** into trading decisions. They‚Äôre like New Year‚Äôs resolutions ‚Äî great in theory, not currently acted upon.

Calculated metrics include:

- **Average Return (Absolute & Decimal)**
- **Sharpe Ratio**
- **Sortino Ratio**
- **Profit Factor**
- **Overall Profit** (planned, not yet implemented)
- **Standard Deviation** of returns
- **Downside Deviation**
- **Holding Period**
- **Expected Risk (absolute, percent, per trade)**
- **Expected Profit**
- **Chance/Risk Ratio**
- **Reward-to-Risk Multiple (R-Multiple)**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

You must create a **config file** that contains:

- Database host, port, user, password  
- Any relevant API keys (e.g., Mailtrap token)

Example (`Configuration.json`):

```properties
{
	"Password":"yourpassword",
	"URL-test_db":"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/test_db",
	"URL-api_key":"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/api_key",
	"URL-financial_data":"jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/financial_data",
	"Username":"yourusername"
}
